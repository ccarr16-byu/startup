> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

QuoteBoard is a place to collaboratively store memories through the use of "boards", where users and their friends can dynamically add quotes, pictures, and doodles to create a personalized digital scrapbook. Registered users can also contribute to public community boards, where they can create with people who share their interests.

### Design

> Mockup; user's home page.

### Key features

- Register/login; show different views when logged in.
- Board creation. Support the following, in order of priority: 1. text 2. images 3. drawings 4. locations
- Social features; friends/requests, sharing boards, dynamic collaboration using WebSocket.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Create separate views so users can choose to browse their own boards, their friends' boards, or community boards.
- **CSS** - Design an unobtrusive and focused UI so users can focus on creating.
- **React** - Utilize specialized components that will allow users to make doodles directly in the browser.
- **Service** - Provide geotagging functionality through the Maps API so users can add locations to boards.
- **DB/Login** - Display in a view-only mode for unregistered users, and provide functionality for users to choose whether to make a board private, public, or shared with friends only.
- **WebSocket** - Update boards dynamically so multiple users can work together at the same time to foster collaboration.

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [My server link](https://startup.quoteboard.click).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - I created views for every part of my project.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I organized my page with headers, footers, navs, divs, and tables.
- [x] **Links** - All pages are properly linked.
- [x] **Text** - I included placeholder "about" text on my homepage.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - I have a line on my login view that indicates I plan to use a 3rd party to process user accounts.
- [x] **Images** - I included profile images on the profile view and the friend request table.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - I created a login view with placeholder fields.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - My "User Boards", "Friends' Boards", and "Community Boards" views will all query a DB to get their content. I will also likely store friend list & friend request information in a DB.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - My "Edit Board" view indicates that it will use WebSocket to display boards live. My friend request table may also use WebSocket so it can update live, but that is lower-priority.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - I refactored my HTML to give my site a clearer structure. My header and footer are now visually cohesive.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I refactored, condensed, and styled my navbar using bootstrap.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - I used flex and grid to make my site responsive to different window sizes.
- [x] **Application elements** - I refactored my login and friend requests/list UI to get rid of extraneous views. These elements will be handled using react.
- [x] **Application text content** - My text content did not change much. I added some more text to my main view to make it fit better on the page.
- [x] **Application images** - I am still using the same images on my profile view. I updated my tables and buttons using bootstrap to look more visually cohesive.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - I had no issues with my deployment or installing Vite & React.
- [x] **Components** - I successfully ported all of my components into React. I simplified a few of my views to reference the same component, which I plan on making serve reactive content.
- [x] **Router** - I had a few hiccups with my router. Since app.jsx imports all of my components at once, all of their stylesheets get imported at once as well, leading to conflicts in my styling. I added tag IDs to my affected html components, and selecting those components by ID fixed the problem.
