You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

QuoteBoard is a place to collaboratively store memories through the use of "boards", where users and their friends can dynamically add quotes, pictures, and doodles to create a personalized digital scrapbook. Registered users can also contribute to public community boards, where they can create with people who share their interests.

### Design

> Mockup; user's home page.

### Key features

- Register/login; show different views when logged in.
- Board creation. Support the following, in order of priority: 1. text 2. images 3. drawings 4. locations
- Social features; friends/requests, sharing boards, dynamic collaboration using WebSocket.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Create separate views so users can choose to browse their own boards, their friends' boards, or community boards.
- **CSS** - Design an unobtrusive and focused UI so users can focus on creating.
- **React** - Utilize specialized components that will allow users to make doodles directly in the browser.
- **Service** - Provide geotagging functionality through the Maps API so users can add locations to boards.
- **DB/Login** - Display in a view-only mode for unregistered users, and provide functionality for users to choose whether to make a board private, public, or shared with friends only.
- **WebSocket** - Update boards dynamically so multiple users can work together at the same time to foster collaboration.

- [x] **Login placeholder** - I created a login view with placeholder fields.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - My "User Boards", "Friends' Boards", and "Community Boards" views will all query a DB to get their content. I will also likely store friend list & friend request information in a DB.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - My "Edit Board" view indicates that it will use WebSocket to display boards live. My friend request table may also use WebSocket so it can update live, but that is lower-priority.
